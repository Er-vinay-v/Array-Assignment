ARRAY ASSIGNMENT SOLUTIONS




1.What is the default value of Array for different data types ?
Ans: In java different-different data types having different default value i.e -
1. byte,short,int ,long →such data types having default value is zero(0).  
2. float and double → such data types having default value is decimal zero(0.0).
3. boolean → by default its value is false.
4. object → null.


2.Can you pass the negative number in Array size ?
Ans: No, i do not pass the negative number in Array size.if i will pass negative size then compiler not identify but during run time it will give error i.e NegativeArraySizeException.


3.Where is Array stored in JVM memory ?
Ans: Array is an object in Java, so basically it provides heap memory in JVM.


4.What are the disadvantages of Array ?
Ans: It has many demerits such as →
a.by nature static in size.
b.it allocates contiguous memory location in heap area.
c.it can store similar data.
d.in worst cases insertion of a new element is very costlier in Array.


5.what is an anonymous Array in Java ?Give an example ?
Ans: Anonymous Array it means such types of array having no any name ,in this type of array we can use only for once in a class.
For example –
Anonymous in type array →
new int[] {1,2,3,4,5,5};


Anonymous char array→
new char[] {‘a’,’b’,’c’};


6.What are the different ways to traverse an Array in Java ?
Ans: There are basically two ways to traverse an Array in Java i.e–
a.By using a for loop.
b.By using a for each loop.


7.What is the difference between length and length() Give an example ?
Ans:Differences between length and length i.e-
1. length :- it is used as a property ,where it counts the insertion and deletion of elements , it returns the total number of elements present in the array.
For example:-


public class Test {
public static void main(String args[]) {
int []arr ={1,2,5,6,7,8,99,0,8};


System.out.println("Length of an array is: " + array.length);
}
}


Output :-length of an array is 9.


2. length() :-   The length() method is a static method of String class.
The length() returns the length of a string object i.e. the number of characters stored in an object.String class uses this method because the length of a string can be modified using the various operations on an object.
The String class internally uses a char[] array that it does not expose to the outside world.


For Example :-
public class Test {
public static void main(String args[]) {
String str = "Welcome in my Assignment";
System.out.println("Length of String using length() method is:
" + str.length());
}
}
Output: Length of String using length() method is: 24
